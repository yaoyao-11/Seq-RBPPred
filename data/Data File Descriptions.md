## Data File Descriptions

1. Deep_RBPpred

   This folder contains data on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and non-RBPs from  DeepRBPPred[1]. This corresponds to Dataset 1 in our paper.

2. EuRBPDB_PDB_data

   This includes RBP and non-RBP data sourced from the EuRBPDB[2] and PDB[3] databases. When combined with the data from the Deep_RBPpred folder, it forms Dataset 2 in our paper.

3. How to Use the Data

   - DeepRBPPred

     The methods from the DeepRBPPred can be employed to make predictions on the independent_test data.

   - Deep_forestï¼ŒDmLab,Random_forest,SVM,Seq-RBPPred

     Datasets 1 and 2 can be utilized for training to create two distinct models. These models can then be applied to make predictions on the independent_test data. The corresponding codes for each method are located in the respective folders: Deep_forest, DmLab, Random_forest, SVM, Seq-RBPPred.
